# docker-kafka-test
A quick POC putting together Kafka as a message broker with a producer and a consumer.

## Getting started

Clone this repo, and from the project root directory, run docker-compose up. This should bring up the Kafka message queue and Zookeeper as well as a producer and a consumer. You can see that they're working correctly by looking at the log output from the producer and the consumer.
